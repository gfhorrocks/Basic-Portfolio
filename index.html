                Hello world! My name is Gregory Frank Horrocks, but you can call me Greg for short. I am a 31 year
                old
                living in the great state of North Carolina, where I have lived most of my life. I enjoy being
                outdoors,
                preferrably during the Spring through Fall months, biking, hiking, playing tennis and hanging out
                at
                the
                beach. When I'm not outdoors, I enjoy playing PC and board games, building stained glass art and
                watching
                movies.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to pick one domesticated animal to live with the rest of my life, I would choose canines.
                The
                bond you can create with these animals can be very deep and sometimes stronger than some human
                relationships because they are unconditional. There isn't anything in the world a dog loves more
                than
                having a caring and strong owner and sidekick in this world!
